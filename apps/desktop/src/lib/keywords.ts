 *
 * Declared, never inferred. Guessing terms out of prose was the alternative and
 * it is a bad one: the vendor cap is small (xAI hard-errors above 100 terms,
 * it does not truncate), so a heuristic that spends the budget on common words
 * makes recognition worse rather than better. Writing the block **is** the
 * opt-in — there is no setting, and that is deliberate.

 * prompt. The second is the typo case — a list nobody closed — and it stops at

 * missing bracket must cost the terms, not the prompt around them.
